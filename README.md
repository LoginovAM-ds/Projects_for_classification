# "Classification projects"

## Description:
This repository is a repository for my data classification projects. Here I'm going to post code and materials related to the development and application of various classification methods in machine learning. My goal is to create understandable and applicable classification examples that can be useful for both beginners and experienced developers and data researche
### In this repository you will find the following sections:

- Examples of projects: Specific projects are presented here, including source code, datasets and instructions for launching them.
- Resources and training materials: Here I will share useful articles, books and online courses that will help in the study of classification methods.
- Documentation: If there are any features of using the code or instructions for setting up the environment, they will be available in this section.
- Contribution to the community: I invite all interested developers and researchers to join the project, contribute and discuss issues related to data classification.
### Thanks to this repository, we can jointly learn and improve our skills in the field of data classification. Feel free to ask questions and share your ideas!
