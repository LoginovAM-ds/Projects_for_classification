# Activity classification project based on accelerometer data
#### Project Description:

This project is dedicated to the classification of activity based on data collected from the accelerometer of a mobile device. The task is to determine the type of activity (for example, walking, running, sitting and others) based on recorded data from the accelerometer and gyroscope.
#### Results
The results show that the model has achieved high performance, especially for the 'LAYING', 'WALKING' and 'WALKING_UPSTANDS' classes, where the F1 measure is 1.00. However, for the 'SITTING' and 'STANDING' classes, the F1 measure is slightly lower, which may require additional research and model improvement which has accuracy score 0.95

#### Project objectives:

1. Data research: Data analysis and visualization, identification of patterns and features.
2. Data preprocessing: Processing missing values, scaling, coding categorical variables.
3. Model Building: Training various machine learning models to classify activity.
4. Performance Evaluation: Evaluation of accuracy and other performance metrics of models based on validation data.
5. Choosing the best model: Choosing the best model using cross-validation and selection of hyperparameters.
6. Documentation: Writing a README file with a description of the project and instructions.
#### This project demonstrates the successful solution of the problem of activity classification based on data using machine learning methods and approaches to evaluating model performance.
