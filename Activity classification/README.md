# Activity classification project based on accelerometer data
#### Project Description:

This project is dedicated to the classification of activity based on data collected from the accelerometer of a mobile device. The task is to determine the type of activity (for example, walking, running, sitting and others) based on recorded data from the accelerometer and gyroscope.
#### Project objectives:

1. Data research: Data analysis and visualization, identification of patterns and features.
2. Data preprocessing: Processing missing values, scaling, coding categorical variables.
3. Model Building: Training various machine learning models to classify activity.
4. Performance Evaluation: Evaluation of accuracy and other performance metrics of models based on validation data.
5. Choosing the best model: Choosing the best model using cross-validation and selection of hyperparameters.
6. Documentation: Writing a README file with a description of the project and instructions.
## Note:

This description provides an overview of the project. If necessary, you can add more detailed information, results and conclusions from data analysis and experiments with models.
